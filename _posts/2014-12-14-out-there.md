title:  Out There

Over a decade ago, I was able to backpack around China primarily because of three friends I met through blogging. Monsoons, nightclubs, falling-outs and food poisoning - it was a pretty cool adventure for a 20 year old.

I wasn't a particularly great writer or artist. Nothing I ever published went beyond the small circle of readers I considered confidantes. But I put myself out there and things seemed to work for a while.
