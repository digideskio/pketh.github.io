title:  "New Voices on the Web"
---

Over a decade ago, I was able to backpack around China primarily because of three girls I met through blogging. Monsoons, nightclubs, falling-outs and food poisoning - it was a pretty cool adventure for a 19 year old.

Could this happen today?

I wasn't a particularly great writer or artist. Nothing I ever published went beyond a small circle of readers I considered confidantes. But things seemed to work.

Looking back through rose-tinted glasses, the [web we lost][dashes] was a place for anonymous, independant voices to find each other.

# Social Pressures in Walled Gardens

Flipping the glasses up. While so much has moved forward, those aspiring to express themselves on the web now need to ask:

1. Do I want people from my real life reading this?

2. Does this live up to the standards of my previous work?

3. Is this what people expect from me?

4. Should I write my own thing or share something else?

For someone new to the web, that's a hell of a mountain to climb. Were I in the same place, I probably wouldn't have bothered.

# Designing for Expressiveness

In my free time, I'm working on [Metome][metome], a personal diary thing. I started building it because there were things I wanted to reflect on and express that I had no real place for.

A good diary is encourages the expressive, raw and unfiltered. There are no social pressures. It should be a guilt free place - if you haven't written in months, or your last entry was a mess, you shouldn't feel bad about that.

> Write for yourself and answer to no one.

I'm hoping that the diary model helps people who'd otherwise struggle with the hump of social sharing to build confidence, find a voice, and - when they're ready - put themselves out there.
