## Once upon a time...

| Artists | Engineers |
| Selling albums | Selling versions | 
| New album | New version |
| CDs | Boxes |
| Record shops | Computer stores |

## The awkward teen years...

| Artists and producers | Engineers and designers |
| Live performances | Subscriptions |
| New singles | New features |
| Streaming | Web apps, app stores |
| Spotify, Apple | Web, iOS, Android |

## Not too long now...

Platforms help us discover, but as the the relationship between creators and their fans becomes more personal, the best stuff is shared & sold directly.
