title:  "Less than Perfect on the Internet"
---

Brent Simmons' recent post, [How to Be Wrong on the Internet][brentSimmons], got me thinking about why I don't write or share as much as I should.

Over a decade ago, I was able to backpack around Eastern China primarily because of three friends I met through blogging. Monsoons, nightclubs, falling-outs and food poisoning - it was a pretty cool adventure for a 20 year old.

I wasn't a particularly great writer or artist. Nothing I ever published went beyond a small circle of readers I considered confidantes. But I put myself out there and things seemed to work out.

I stopped for lots of reasons, probably. If I'm being honest, I can't really recall.

But somewhere along the way I started being overly self-critical, believing that anything I put out had to be perfect.

I like the way Brent thinks about it better:

> I’m constantly wrong on the internet. Here’s how I think about it:

> Blogging is, for me, part of the process of getting to the truth.

> Everything is provisional — it’s what I think now, and I might change my mind in a year. Or in a day. Or in a minute, when somebody posts (or tweets) more or better information or has a solid argument.

To that end, I took a break from coding [Tello][tello] last week to noodle around with watercolors. Here's one of the things I did. It's far from good, or finished, but that's okay.

Despite the amateur results, dipping my toes in the world of real paints and brushes was totally worth it.
