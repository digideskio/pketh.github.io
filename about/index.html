 <p>Howdy,</p>

  <p>My name is Pirijan, I'm product designer trying to build software that tangles chaos and expresses personality. Basically, software that doesn't suck.</p>

  <p>Turns out, that's pretty fucking hard. So maybe that's what this site will be about. Yeah, I really just now figured that out.</p>

  <p>YOLO.</p>
